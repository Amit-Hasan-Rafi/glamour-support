                <p className='font-semibold'>If you’ve ever heard anyone speak about the power that makeup holds, they’re talking about its transformative quality. Makeup, when used well, can create dramatic makeovers. A full-coverage concealer can hide a full face of acne, and an expertly-applied lip liner can make your lips look fuller. Beyond that, special effects makeup can turn you into a zombie bride or skeleton. When you see before and afters, it becomes quite clear just how powerful makeup can be.

                    One of our favorite examples of this is contouring. You can create the appearance of more defined cheekbones, a slimmer nose, a poutier bottom lip, and a more angular jawline, all with a little contour makeup.
